# Pi-Soundplayer

This Repository is created to give everyone the chance to play Music on the Pi.

This Repository installs multiple Sound services to let you play music by Spotify Connect, Airplay and Bluetooth.

I want to add Google Assistant, Alexa and Mopidy.
I am not a good programmer so I cant help everyone.

Now comes the fun part. 

First we update the system and install git.

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get install git

This can take some time...

Now we clone my repository.

git clone https://github.com/AlexProgrammerDE/Pi-Soundplayer.git

Now we run my installation script.
